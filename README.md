First Decentralized Software Company repository

Imagine a job listing auction system based on blockchain decentralizing technology. Imagine you can work for a brand of software development which has no boss, just made by and for software developers of any kind. A blockchain capable of storing all the company data, activity and even its economy. It depends on just itself, without country nor homeland. Just focused on developing software and give the tools to our sector to carry projects in a decentralized but warrantyful way. 

Companies would not need to hire software developers anymore. This is not another freelance platform, it is an entire environment build to help software developers to reach their goals. To allow mankind to reach everyday the more complex problems the better, in the name of excellence and progress. 

---- V1.0 ----

As a developer you just build your profile and start working with a group or just on your own. But remember, mankind didn't reached this point without collaboration, which is the most important progress ever. You will aquire a level of excellence based on the feedback given by other platform users.

As a company you can update projects with a public listing ad with an estimated budget, and another more detailed description for those developers you choose to assign the task to.

The auction has a deadline and the company must deposit the money to the platform
